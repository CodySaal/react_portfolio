# React Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project was to practice using React. Building the project gave me the opportunity to work with IndexDB and webpack. This projects has both a front and back end so I was able to deploy it using Heroku. This gave me more experience with using Heroku to deploy live applications. The application itself can be used as any other text editor. It can even be downloaded to the device and used offline.

## Installation

The user can clone the code from the GitHub repo. Once the code is cloned and opened in a code editor the user should install all npm packages by running 
```
npm i
```
To invoke the application the user can run 

```
npm start
```
If the user wants to run in a dev environment so the server refreshes after changes are made the user should run
```
npm run start:dev
```

## Usage

The applications usage is fairly typical to other text editors. This one, being a PWA, can be installed on the users device and runs similar to a native app. This will also allow the user to use J.A.T.E while being offline. All text is saved once the user clicks off of the editor.
