# React Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project was to practice using React. Building the project gave me the opportunity to work on making reusable componenets and working with state. This projects has only a front end so I was able to deploy it using Github Pages. This gave me more experience with using the gh-pages npm package. The application itself will be used to store all of my projects that I make so that future employers can see my ability.
